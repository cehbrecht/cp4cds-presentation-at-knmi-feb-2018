## ruth on data service slides

this is what I have put together for you for the WP2 data management stuff for the magic meeting, 
please use slides 4 and 5 of this .pptx in place of your slide 8 and 9. 
Note that for CP4CDS we have not done any replication at this stage that will come later, 
so I think for the purposes of this talk it is not relevant. 
The main thing is to advertise the web app cp4cds-qcapp.ceda.ac.uk (certificate comingâ€¦) 
Please let me know if you have any questions or need the original .png screenshots.
