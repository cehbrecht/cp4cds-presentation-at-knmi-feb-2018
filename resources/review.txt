## ruth on data service slides

this is what I have put together for you for the WP2 data management stuff for the magic meeting,
please use slides 4 and 5 of this .pptx in place of your slide 8 and 9.
Note that for CP4CDS we have not done any replication at this stage that will come later,
so I think for the purposes of this talk it is not relevant.
The main thing is to advertise the web app cp4cds-qcapp.ceda.ac.uk (certificate coming…)
Please let me know if you have any questions or need the original .png screenshots.

## phil on docker slides

I would say also that we need to establish our own Docker repository for production use.
It’s OK to use Docker Cloud for dev and testing
